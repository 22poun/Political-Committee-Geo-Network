Continuation of our study of utilizing political campaign contribution networks to study federal election races. 

Things we want to do:
  1. Apply the same code for 2008-2010 to 2012-2016 (and eventually 2018 once the cycle has finished)
  2. Investigate House, presidential, and primary races
  3. see if we can utilize these techniques to study gerrymandering in a given state over a period of time
